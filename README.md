# Web-Final
Site Purpose:
I wanted to make a site about the Portland Trail Blazers that provided the sort of information you might find from the team's social media and ESPN. The site has the team roster, stats, schedule, and more about the team.

Pages:
All of the pages were: Home, Roster, Stats, Schedule, Social Media, Highlights, and Contact.

Features:
Some of the things I'm most happy with how they turned out was the social media page that has the team's Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. I also liked how all of the tables turned out on the roster, stats, and schedule pages.

Design:
My design choice was inspired by the teams colors: Red, Black, White, Silver; and the structure was inspired by previous projects in class. The structure felt clean and easy to navigate which is why I chose it.

Problems/Challenges:
My biggest issue was getting the responsive design to work well. Shrinking the window on some pages will extend the nav bar past the rest of the page. 

Knowledge/Experience Gained:
Previous to this semester, my only programming knowledge was very basic HTML that I learned in high school. We typed up every page we did in notepad and never even talked about CSS. I've learned a lot about the different strategies to developing a web page, but know there is still a lot more that can be learned. I'm glad to have learned about CSS because it makes the design aspect of web pages far easier. I gained an interest in programming during high school and I'm glad to have finally had a place to learn and create things with code. It was always rewarding to see the final result of several lines of text turned into a functional program/website.
